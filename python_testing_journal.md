read unit-testing-in-python:

I am a dev now. Patching doesn't mean patching OS or software. I love patching, I don't have patching anymore.

tox and project test can be a template

folder structure for python code and tests, just use code and test

python test in ci-pipeline comparision and implementation

mutmut for mutating code for testing, tried out

pytest plugins
